  _Published: Aug 14, 2025_

 In todayâ€™s world, we use biometric logins, PINs, passwordless sign-ins, and passkeys.
 Itâ€™s easy to forget the old-school passwords.

 But in Active Directory disaster recovery, one old-school password still matters: the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password.

 Every AD admin will eventually face a moment when a Domain Controller wonâ€™t start normally.
 To repair AD, youâ€™ll boot into DSRM â€” and if you donâ€™t have that password, youâ€™re stuck. ðŸ¥¸

 Why this happens:
	â€¢	It was set by an admin who left years ago.
	â€¢	It was never documented.
	â€¢	It hasnâ€™t been tested in years.
	â€¢	The DC has never crashed, so no one realised it was missing.

Key fact:
DSRM passwords can only be reset while DCs are running normally.
If AD DS is already down, you canâ€™t change it â€” a true chicken-and-egg problem.

Letâ€™s make sure that never happens to you.

## **1. Choosing the Right DSRM Management Approach**

The right approach depends on how many DCs you manage.

### **Small to Medium Environments (up to ~20â€“30 DCs)**

* Assign **unique DSRM passwords per DC**.
* Store each in a **secure, audited password vault**.
* Strongest isolation â€” compromise of one DCâ€™s password doesnâ€™t affect others.

### **Large Environments (50â€“100+ DCs)**

* Use **Sync-from-Domain-Account** for easier maintenance.
* Sets each DCâ€™s DSRM password to match a dedicated, non-privileged domain account.
* Rotate that one password, then re-sync to all DCs in bulk.
* Remember: this is a one-time sync â€” you must re-run after each change.

## **2. Resetting the DSRM Password**

### **Option A â€“ Manual Per DC**
\`\`\`cmd
ntdsutil "set dsrm password" "reset password on server null" "quit" "quit"
\`\`\`
(_server null_ = the DC you are on)

### **Option B â€“ Sync From Domain Account**
\`\`\`cmd
ntdsutil "set dsrm password" "sync from domain account DSRM-Sync-User" "quit" "quit"
\`\`\`
or Note cmd is:  _ntdsutil "set dsrm password" "sync from domain account Domain\DSRM-Sync-User" "quit" "quit"_

* This requires a **dedicated domain account** with no elevated privileges.
* The DSRM password will match this accountâ€™s password across all DCs.
* Use this method if you have many DCs and want to avoid managing unique passwords.

### **Example PowerShell Script for Sync Method**

Hereâ€™s a quick PowerShell script to set the DSRM password across all DCs using the sync method:

\`\`\`powershell
$domainAccount = "CONTOSO\DSRM-Sync-User"
$dcList = Get-ADDomainController -Filter *

foreach ($dc in $dcList) {
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $dc.HostName -ScriptBlock {
        ntdsutil "set dsrm password" "sync from domain account $using:domainAccount"
    }
}
\`\`\`

* This script retrieves all domain controllers and runs the DSRM sync command on each.
* Ensure you run this with appropriate permissions.

### **Important Notes**

- **Run as Administrator**: You must run these commands with elevated privileges.
- **Backup First**: Always ensure you have a backup of your AD before making changes.
- **Test in a Lab**: If possible, test the DSRM password reset process in a lab environment first.

## **3. Testing the DSRM Password**

Itâ€™s not enough to set the password â€” you need to confirm it works **before** a disaster.

### **A. Offline Test (Most Reliable)**

1. Set the DC to boot into DSRM:
   \`\`\`cmd
   bcdedit /set safeboot dsrepair  
   shutdown /r /f /t 5
   \`\`\`
2. At logon, sign in as:

 \`\`\`cmd
   .\Administrator
   \`\`\`

   with your DSRM password.

3. **Revert safeboot afterward** to normal boot:
   \`\`\`cmd
   bcdedit /deletevalue safeboot  
   shutdown /r /f /t 5
   \`\`\`

### **B. Online Test (Quick Check)**

_(Less secure â€” use only briefly, then revert.)_

1. Temporarily allow DSRM login in normal mode:
   \`\`\`powershell
   reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa /v DsrmAdminLogonBehavior /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
   \`\`\`
2. Log off and sign in as:
   \`\`\`cmd
   .\Administrator
   \`\`\`
3. **Revert registry to default (0) after testing**:
   \`\`\`powershell
   reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa /v DsrmAdminLogonBehavior /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   \`\`\`

---

## **4. Best Practices**

* Store DSRM credentials in a **secure vault**.
* Test the password **at least twice a year**.
* Never leave _DsrmAdminLogonBehavior_ at _2_.
* If using **sync method**:
  * Keep the sync account non-privileged.
  * Rotate and re-sync regularly.
* If using **unique passwords**:
  * Use a vault with expiry and auditing features.

## **Final Word**

Whether you go with **unique-per-DC** or **sync-from-domain-account**, the goal is the same â€” a **known, tested, and recoverable DSRM password** for every Domain Controller you manage.
Itâ€™s one of those admin tasks you wonâ€™t think about â€” until you desperately need it. And when that day comes, youâ€™ll be glad you planned ahead.
