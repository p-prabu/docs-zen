# **Getting DSRM Password Under Control – Practical Guide for Admins**

There will come a day in almost every AD admin’s career when you have to boot a Domain Controller into **Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)** — maybe for an authoritative restore, repairing the AD database, or performing offline maintenance.

When that day comes, you’ll need the **local DSRM Administrator password**. And here’s the reality: too often, teams get stuck because no one remembers it.

* It was set by an admin who’s long gone.
* It was configured during DC promotion years ago and never documented.
* It was never updated, and the vault entry (if one exists) is empty.

To make matters worse, the DSRM password can **only** be reset while the DC is running normally. If AD DS won’t start and you don’t have the password, you’ve got yourself a classic **chicken-and-egg problem**.

Let’s make sure that never happens to you.

## **1. Choosing the Right DSRM Management Approach**

The right approach depends on how many DCs you manage.

### **Small to Medium Environments (up to \~20–30 DCs)**

* Assign **unique DSRM passwords per DC**.
* Store each in a **secure, audited password vault**.
* Strongest isolation — compromise of one DC’s password doesn’t affect others.

### **Large Environments (50–100+ DCs)**

* Use **Sync-from-Domain-Account** for easier maintenance.
* Sets each DC’s DSRM password to match a dedicated, non-privileged domain account.
* Rotate that one password, then re-sync to all DCs in bulk.
* Remember: this is a one-time sync — you must re-run after each change.

## **2. Resetting the DSRM Password**

### **Option A – Manual Per DC**

```cmd
ntdsutil "set dsrm password" "reset password on server null" "quit" "quit"
```

(`server null` = the DC you are on)

### **Option B – Sync From Domain Account**

```cmd
ntdsutil "set dsrm password" "sync from domain account CONTOSO\DSRM-Sync-User" "quit" "quit"
```

* Run locally on each DC or automate with PowerShell and `Invoke-Command`.
* Use a **dedicated** account just for DSRM sync.
* Store that account’s password in the vault.

## **3. Testing the DSRM Password**

It’s not enough to set the password — you need to confirm it works **before** a disaster.

---

### **A. Offline Test (Most Reliable)**

1. Set the DC to boot into DSRM:

   ```cmd
   bcdedit /set safeboot dsrepair
   shutdown /r /f /t 5
   ```
2. At logon, sign in as:

   ```
   .\Administrator
   ```

   with your DSRM password.
3. **Revert safeboot afterward** to normal boot:

   ```cmd
   bcdedit /deletevalue safeboot
   shutdown /r /f /t 5
   ```

---

### **B. Online Test (Quick Check)**

*(Less secure — use only briefly, then revert.)*

1. Temporarily allow DSRM login in normal mode:

   ```cmd
   reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v DsrmAdminLogonBehavior /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
   ```
2. Log off and sign in as:

   ```
   .\Administrator
   ```
3. **Revert registry to default (0) after testing**:

   ```cmd
   reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v DsrmAdminLogonBehavior /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   ```

---

## **4. Best Practices**

* Store DSRM credentials in a **secure vault**.
* Test the password **at least twice a year**.
* Never leave `DsrmAdminLogonBehavior` at `2`.
* If using **sync method**:

  * Keep the sync account non-privileged.
  * Rotate and re-sync regularly.
* If using **unique passwords**:

  * Use a vault with expiry and auditing features.

---

## **Final Word**

Whether you go with **unique-per-DC** or **sync-from-domain-account**, the goal is the same — a **known, tested, and recoverable DSRM password** for every Domain Controller you manage.

It’s one of those admin tasks you won’t think about — until you desperately need it. And when that day comes, you’ll be glad you planned ahead.
