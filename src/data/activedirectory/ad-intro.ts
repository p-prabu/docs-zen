# Introduction to Active Directory

Welcome to our comprehensive documentation on Microsoft Active Directory (AD). This guide will help you understand the fundamentals of Active Directory and how it plays a critical role in enterprise IT environments.

## What is Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a **directory service developed by Microsoft** for Windows domain networks. It is used for **identity management**, **authentication**, and **access control** within an organization. AD allows IT administrators to manage users, computers, groups, policies, and other resources in a centralized and secure manner.

### Key Features

- **Centralized Management**: Manage users, groups, and devices from a single location
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure access to resources using credentials and group memberships
- **Group Policy Management**: Enforce security and configuration policies across the organization
- **Replication**: Ensures consistency of directory data across multiple domain controllers
- **Scalability**: Supports millions of objects and large-scale enterprises

## Active Directory Components

To begin your journey with Active Directory, it's important to understand its core components:

1. **Domain Controllers** – Servers that store and manage directory data
2. **Users and Groups** – The digital identities and their relationships
3. **Organizational Units (OUs)** – Logical containers to organize objects
4. **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** – Rules and settings applied to users and computers
5. **Sites and Services** – Manage network topology and replication
6. **Trusts** – Relationships between different domains for resource sharing
