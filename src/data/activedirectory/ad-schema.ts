# Active Directory Schema

The Active Directory schema defines the structure and rules for objects that can be stored in the Active Directory database. Understanding the schema is crucial for extending and customizing your AD environment.

## What is Active Directory Schema?

The schema is a blueprint that defines what types of objects can be created in Active Directory and what attributes those objects can have. It acts as a rulebook that ensures data consistency and integrity across the directory.

### Schema Components

#### Object Classes
Object classes define the types of objects that can be created in Active Directory, such as:
- **User**: Represents user accounts
- **Computer**: Represents computer accounts  
- **Group**: Represents security and distribution groups
- **Organizational Unit**: Container objects for organizing other objects

#### Attributes
Attributes define the properties that objects can have:
- **Mandatory Attributes**: Required properties that must be populated
- **Optional Attributes**: Properties that can be left empty
- **Single-valued**: Can contain only one value
- **Multi-valued**: Can contain multiple values

## Schema Management

### Schema Master
The schema master is the domain controller responsible for schema modifications. Only one schema master exists per forest.

### Schema Modifications
- Schema changes are forest-wide and irreversible
- Require Schema Admin privileges
- Should be thoroughly tested before implementation
- There are three ways to modify the schema:
  - Through the Active Directory Schema MMC snap-in
  - Using LDIF files  
  - Programmatically using ADSI or LDAP

To know about MMC snap-in, we will use the first method, using Active Directory Schema MMC snap-in.

### Best Practices
- Always backup before schema changes
- Test in a lab environment first
- Document all custom schema extensions
- Follow Microsoft naming conventions

## AD Schema Extension – Think Twice Before You Do It

Adding a new attribute to the AD schema is not just another task.
It's a permanent change — you can't undo it.

If something goes wrong, the only way to fix it is to restore from backup and rebuild all your AD servers. That's a lot of effort, downtime, and coordination.

So, before touching the schema, make sure you go through a proper checklist.

### What to Check Before Making a Schema Change

1. **Are you aware this is a permanent change?**
   - Schema changes replicate to all Domain Controllers.
   - There's no rollback unless you restore everything from backup.

2. **Did you test it in QA or test environment?**
   - Always validate in a test setup before you even think about production.

3. **Are all Domain Controllers healthy and replicating?**
   - Run your checks — dcdiag, repadmin, etc.
   - Don't proceed if any DC is unhealthy or has replication issues.

4. **Do you have the required access?**
   - You need to be a member of Schema Admins and Domain Admins.
   - Do the change on the Domain Controller holding the Schema Master FSMO role.

5. **Is your OID ready and correctly planned?**
   - Don't use random values.
   - Keep your planned OID and attribute design documented.

6. **Do you really need a new attribute?**
   - Can you re-use any existing unused attribute?
   - Avoid unnecessary additions.

7. **Are you creating a new class or just an attribute?**
   - If a new class, check its parent class. Don't blindly use top or person.

8. **Have you defined the full attribute details?**
   - ldapDisplayName
   - Description
   - Syntax or data type
   - Length (if string)
   - Min/Max (if number)
   - Single-value or multi-value
   - Should it be indexed?
   - Confidential or not?

9. **Who is this attribute meant for?**
   - User? Group? Computer?
   - Clarify the mapping clearly.

10. **Did you review this with your team?**
    - Discuss it before implementing.
    - If anyone raised concerns, did you address them?
    - Use the 4-eyes method — always have one more person watching during the change.

11. **Are you fully confident?**
    - Even 1% doubt — stop and think again.
    - Don't push the change unless you're sure.

12. **Is the documentation complete?**
    - Include what, why, where, how — and the test validation.
    - Make it easy for future reference if any change or troubleshooting is needed.

13. **After implementation, did you check replication?**
    - Confirm the schema change replicated across all DCs.
    - Don't assume — verify.

### Final Reminder
- Schema changes are serious and permanent.
- Don't rush — plan properly.
- If done right, it's a smooth job. If not, can cause real pain.
