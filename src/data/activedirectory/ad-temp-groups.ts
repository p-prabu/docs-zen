Modern IT environments are dynamic. Administrators often need to grant privileges for a limited timeâ€”for example, to install software, perform a pilot test or allow a vendor to configure a system. Unfortunately, human nature means that temporary permissions are seldom revoked when the job is done...

## Dynamic objects: temporary groups with a time-to-live

...

\`\`\`powershell
# How long should the group live?
$TTLMinutes = 15    
$TTLSeconds = [int](New-TimeSpan -Minutes $TTLMinutes).TotalSeconds 

# Bind to the destination OU 
$destinationOu = "OU=TempGroups,DC=contoso,DC=com" 
$destinationOuObject = [ADSI]("LDAP://$destinationOu") 

# Create the dynamic group 
$GroupName = "AppInstallTeam" 
$TempGroup = $destinationOuObject.Create("group", "CN=$GroupName") 
$TempGroup.PutEx(2, "objectClass", @("dynamicObject", "group")) 
$TempGroup.Put("entryTTL", $TTLSeconds) 
$TempGroup.Put("sAMAccountName", $GroupName)
$TempGroup.Put("displayName", "Application Installation Team")
$expiryTime = (Get-Date).AddSeconds($TTLSeconds)
$TempGroup.Put("description", "Will be deleted at $expiryTime (UTC)")
$TempGroup.SetInfo() 

# Add the installers to this dynamic group and nest it into Domain Admins 
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $GroupName -Members "Alice","Bob" 
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members $GroupName
\`\`\`

...

## Scenario 2: pilot testing or proof-of-concept

...

\`\`\`powershell
# Enable PAM
Enable-ADOptionalFeature 'Privileged Access Management Feature' -Scope ForestOrConfigurationSet -Target contoso.com

# Set a TTL of 1 day for the test membership
$ttl = New-TimeSpan -Days 1

# Add the pilot tester to the group for one day
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Test-App-Admins" -Members "PilotUser" -MemberTimeToLive $ttl

# Verify the TTL
Get-ADGroup "Test-App-Admins" -Property member -ShowMemberTimeToLive
\`\`\`
